NAME
     ptyjig - pseudo-terminal pipe

SYNOPSIS
     ptyjig [ option ] ...  command [ args ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     _P_t_y_j_i_g executes the Unix _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with _a_r_g_s as its  arguments
     if  supplied.  The standard input of ptyjig is piped to _c_o_m_-
     _m_a_n_d as if typed at a terminal.  Ptyjig is  expected  to  be
     used  with _f_u_z_z(_1) to test interactive (terminal based) pro-
     grams. If the test program is stopped by a Control-Z, it  is
     resumed immediately.

     The following options can be specified.

     -e   Do not send EOF character after _s_t_d_i_n has exhausted.

     -s   Do not  process  interrupt  signals,  such  as  SIGINT,
          SIGQUIT and SIGSTOP.

     -x   Do not write output from _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

     -i _f_i_l_e
          Save the input stream sent to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d into _f_i_l_e.

     -o _f_i_l_e
          Save the output produced by _c_o_m_m_a_n_d into _f_i_l_e.

     -d _d_e_l_a_y
          Wait _d_e_l_a_y seconds after sending each character.

     -t _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
          If input has exhausted but _c_o_m_m_a_n_d has  neither  exited
          nor  sent  any  output,  exit  after  _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l seconds.
          Default is 2.0 seconds.

     _D_e_l_a_y and _i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l can have fractions.

EXAMPLE
     ptyjig -o out -d 0.2 -t 10 vi text1 <text2

     Runs "vi text1" in  background,  typing  the  characters  in
     _t_e_x_t_2 into it with a delay of 0.2sec between characters, and
     save the output to _o_u_t. The program stops when _v_i stops out-
     putting for 10 seconds.

BUGS
     The trace files specified by -i and -o options  may  contain
     more  than  actual characters sent to and received from _c_o_m_-
     _m_a_n_d. This is due to the fact that after _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  exits  and
     before _p_t_y_j_i_g is signaled, some characters may be sent. This
     can be prevented by  setting  -d  option  to  some  suitable
     delay.
