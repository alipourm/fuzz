NAME
     fuzz - random character generator

SYNOPSIS
     fuzz length [ option ] ...

DESCRIPTION
     The main purpose of _f_u_z_z is to test the robustness of system
     utilities.  We use _f_u_z_z to generate random characters. These
     are then piped to  a  system  utility  (using  _p_t_y_j_i_g(_1)  if
     necessary.) If the utility crashes, the saved input and out-
     put streams can then be analyzed to  decide  what  sorts  of
     input cause problems.

     _L_e_n_g_t_h is taken to be the length of the output stream,  usu-
     ally  in  bytes,  When  -l  is  selected it the length is in
     number of strings.

     The following options can be specified.

     -0   Include NULL (ASCII 0) characters

     -a   Include all ASCII characters except NULL (default)

     -d _d_e_l_a_y
          Specify a delay in seconds between each character.

     -e _s_t_r_i_n_g
          Send _s_t_r_i_n_g after all the characters. This feature  can
          be  used  to  send termination strings to the test pro-
          grams. Standard C escape sequences can be used.

     -l [_l_e_n]
          Generate random length strings. If _l_e_n is specified, it
          is  taken  to  be  the  maximum  length  of each string
          (default = 255).  Strings are terminated with the ASCII
          newline character.

     -o _f_i_l_e
          Store the output stream to _f_i_l_e as well as sending them
          to _s_t_d_o_u_t.

     -p   Generate printable ASCII characters only

     -r _f_i_l_e
          Replay characters stored in _f_i_l_e.

     -s _s_e_e_d
          Use _s_e_e_d as the seed to the random number generator.

     -x   Print the seed as the first line of stdout.
